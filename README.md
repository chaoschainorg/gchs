## Go chs

The chs protocol is implemented in Golang and uses same Ethash algorithm as Ethereum blockchain. The inspiration of chs, is to make a superior or more advanced version of Original gchs and uses Ethereum blockchain which is safer and faster blockchain than the Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain.


Building chs client requires both a Go (version 1.8 or later) and a C compiler.

## Build instructions for Mac

Clone the repository to a directory of your choosing:
```
git clone 
```

Building chs requires the Go compiler:
```
brew install go
```
Finally, build the chs program using the following command.
```
cd gchs
make
```
If you see some errors related to header files of Mac OS system library, install XCode Command Line Tools, and try again.
```
xcode-select --install
```
You can now run ```build/bin/gchs``` to start your node. 

You can also run ```sudo cp ./build/bin/gchs /usr/local/bin/gchs``` and then run ```gchs``` from any directory.   

chs client will now start downloading blocks. Wait till your node synchronises with the network to start activities such as mining.
## Build instructions for Windows

The Chocolatey package manager provides an easy way to get the required build tools installed. If you don't have chocolatey yet, follow the instructions on https://chocolatey.org to install it first.

Then open an Administrator command prompt and install the build tools we need:
```
C:\Windows\system32> choco install git
C:\Windows\system32> choco install golang
C:\Windows\system32> choco install mingw
```

Installing these packages will set up the Path environment variable. Open a new command prompt to get the new Path. The following steps don't need Administrator privileges.

Please ensure that the installed Go version is 1.8 (or any later version).

First we'll create and set up a Go workspace directory layout, then clone the source.

OBS If, during the commands below, you get the following message:
```
 WARNING: The data being saved is truncated to 1024 characters.
```
Then that means that the ```setx``` command will fail, and proceeding will truncate the ```Path/GOPATH```. If this happens, it's better to abort, and try to make some more room in ```Path``` before trying again.

```
C:\Users\xxx> set "GOPATH=%USERPROFILE%"
C:\Users\xxx> set "Path=%USERPROFILE%\bin;%Path%"
C:\Users\xxx> setx GOPATH "%GOPATH%"
C:\Users\xxx> setx Path "%Path%"
C:\Users\xxx> git clone ...
C:\Users\xxx> cd gchs
C:\Users\xxx> go get -u -v golang.org/x/net/context
```

Finally, the command to compile chs is:

```
C:\Users\xxx\gchs> go install -v ./cmd/gchs
```
You can now run ```build/bin/gchs.exe``` to start your node.

chs client will now start downloading blocks. Wait till your node synchronises with the network to start activities such as mining.

### NOTE ###

We have provided executable binaries for windows, in case you face issues in building chs on windows. You can also build the executable if you wish. Below are the steps to follow :

1. Run ```cd build/bin```.
2. Run ```gchs.exe init genesis.json```, depends on your Windows environment.


## Build instructions for Ubuntu

Clone the repository to a directory of your choosing:
```
git clone
```

Install latest distribution of Go (v1.8) if you don't have it already. 

Building ```gchs``` requires Go and C compilers to be installed:
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential golang
```
Finally, build the ```gchs``` program using the following command.
```
cd gchs
make -j
```
You can now run ```build/bin/gchs``` to start your node. 

You can also run ```sudo cp ./build/bin/gchs /usr/local/bin/gchs``` and then run ```gchs``` from any directory. 

chs client will now start downloading blocks. Wait till your node synchronises with the network to start activities such as mining.


### Programatically interfacing chs nodes

chs has built in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs. These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by chs, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: "admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3")
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a chs node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!
